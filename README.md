Vacation Purchasing Website is a basic full-stack application built using Java, Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, and MySQL. The site simulates a simple e-commerce experience for purchasing vacation packages. Users can browse available vacation options and proceed to “purchase” them using a structured form.

This project demonstrates backend functionality with MVC design, form handling, and relational database integration using Spring Data JPA. It also includes basic front-end templating with Thymeleaf to dynamically render vacation data and confirm user purchases.

The goal of the project was to explore how to build and connect a Spring Boot backend to a MySQL database while implementing real-world functionality like POST form handling and object-relational mapping. This application also served as practice for integrating front-end HTML/CSS with Java controllers.
